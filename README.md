#  Plant Disease Detection using OpenCV  

## Overview  
This is a beginner-friendly project that classifies plant leaves as healthy or diseased using OpenCV and Python. Instead of ML, it analyzes green intensity levels to make a prediction dynamically.  

## How It Works  
1. Upload a leaf image (JPG/PNG).  
2. The script extracts green intensity and calculates a threshold.  
3. If green intensity is above the threshold - Healthy Leaf 
4. Otherwise - Possibly Diseased Leaf

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
